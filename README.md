build your .hex files with .dat files with easykeymap
GH60 boards can be built with ATMEL flip but ensure you have the correct drivers for the microcontroller
Satan boards have been built with tkg-toolkit and if im not mistaken it requires antoher driver for the microcontroller (not sure which one though, google is your friend)
